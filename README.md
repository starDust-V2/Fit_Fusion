# Fit_Fusion:
Our AI physical fitness app addresses several common problems associated with staying healthy and fit. These include the lack of motivation to hit the gym, the high cost and time commitment required to attend a gym, and the challenge of finding expert guidance for fitness exercises. Without exercise, people are at risk for a range of health problems, including obesity, heart disease, and more.

Fit-Fusion is designed to solve these problems by providing an expert system for training physical fitness exercises in the comfort of the user's home. The system uses live detection to ensure that the user is maintaining the correct posture while performing exercises. It also provides real-time counting of the number of repetitions completed during each exercise.

Our platform provides a community space where fitness enthusiasts can share their experiences, provide feedback, and support each other. By connecting users with others who share their goals, we hope to create a sense of community and motivation that encourages them to stay on track with their fitness goals.

Our app also offers incentives to users in the form of an in-app called Fit-coin, which can be earned by completing daily workout sessions. These coins have real monetary value and can be used as vouchers or coupons at various e-commerce sites. Additionally, our app features a daily streak system, which motivates users to maintain their workout habits and make exercise a regular part of their daily routine.

Overall, our AI-powered fitness app provides a comprehensive solution to the common problems associated with staying healthy and fit. By combining expert guidance, real-time feedback, community support, and incentives, we hope to empower users to achieve their fitness goals and live healthier, happier lives.
